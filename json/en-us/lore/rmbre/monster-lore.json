Each long rest the creature spends in a vat or jar of pickling brine prolongs the curse by 1 day.\n\nA lycanthropickle can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthropickle retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its boring life as it always has, burying deep its raging, murderous urges just like the rest of us.\n\nSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. They can assume pickle form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropickles that embrace their briny natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.\n\nIn hybrid form, a lycanthropickle has the same statistics as a twig blight with the altered ability noted here.\n\nIn pickle form, a lycanthropickle has no statistics and is indistinguishable from a pickle... because it's a pickle."
