Decapuses also use their tentacles to climb walls and ceilings.\n\nAfter securing a high vantage point, a decapus hangs by one tentacle and attacks with the other nine. On the ground, a decapus is slower and less dangerous. It must use half of its tentacles to support its weight upright, leaving five tentacles with which it can attack and defend itself."

A geonid's arms and legs come out of a small opening in the bottom of its shell. A geonid can draw its limbs into its shell and close the opening. When it does so, the creature looks like a small boulder. In this state, the geonid can't see and relies on its tremorsense to detect other creatures nearby."

Geonids like to collect coins and gemstones, and they rarely confront creatures larger than themselves except to rob them or scare them away."

Geonids use this ability to track prey and to determine whether other creatures have trespassed in their territory. The information gleaned is imprecise and doesn't include the specific identities of such creatures or the precise times when they passed nearby."

Before a topi is animated, its corpse is shrunk until it stands only 2 feet tall, and its heart is cut out and replaced with a leather bag that contains a live poisonous snake. The snake requires neither air nor sustenance, and it magically renders the topi's claws venomous. When a topi dies, the snake inside it dies too. The process of creating a topi is known only to a handful of evil priests and necromancers.\n\nTopis are more difficult to turn than ordinary zombies, and their spongy bodies make them resistant to bludgeoning."
