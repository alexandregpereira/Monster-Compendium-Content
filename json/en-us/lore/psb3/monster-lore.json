During combat, they can enter a battle trance known as a Rage, which enhances their strength and resilience. The unyielding endurance and savage power unleashed during this state are legendary, allowing the Barbarian to shrug off attacks while striking down their foes with ease.\n\nBarbarians are not simply mindless brutes. They have an affinity for nature, much like a druid, but their connection is much rawer, more visceral. They use their instincts more than wisdom to navigate the wild, relying on gut feelings and natural intuition."

Their power comes not only from innate talent but also from meticulous study, careful research, and a deep understanding of the principles that govern the universe.\n\nEvery wizard carries a spellbook, a tome filled with the formulae for casting spells. It is their most treasured possession, a compendium of their life's work, and a wizard will guard their spellbook with their life."

With every spell they cast, every ritual they perform, they push the boundaries of what is possible, ever driven by the pursuit of knowledge and the power that it holds."

Where wizards have spellbooks, a sorcerer’s ability to cast spells is as natural as breathing or heartbeat. This instinctual nature can make sorcerers more flexible in casting their spells and enables them to manipulate their magic in ways wizards cannot.\n\nDespite this power, a sorcerer's magic is a double-edged sword. It is a part of them, as constant and necessary as breath, but it is also wild and unpredictable, often manifesting in unexpected ways."

The Wild Magic origin represents a sorcerer who is touched by chaos, their spells often producing random and unpredictable effects. Other sorcerous origins include the divine-touched Divine Soul, the otherworldly Shadow Magic, and more, each providing unique abilities and shaping the sorcerer’s magical path."

They can use their Sorcery Points to manipulate their spellcasting, reshaping a spell’s energy to perform at a higher level, cast quickly, or even be sustained for a longer duration. This raw and flexible magic, combined with their natural charisma, often makes them inspiring and influential individuals, despite the unpredictable nature of their power."
