Tall and slender, with dark hair and (illusory) feathered wings that gently fan the air, Aerisi Kalinoth speaks to her people in a whisper that belies her violent temper, which reveals itself whenever she is denied.\n\nAerisi was a sheltered moon elf princess named Dara Algwynenn Kalinoth who grew up in a remote Faerie realm. Her parents had wished to protect her from the harsh realities of the world, but they only succeeded in spoiling her. When they tried to discipline their wilful daughter, she used the power of elemental air against them. Soon after, her dreams led her to the ancient dwarven ruins where the spear Windvane awaited her.\n\nDara changed her name to Aerisi and pretended to be an avariel (winged elf) princess like the ones from her storybooks. Then Aerisi used her talents for enchantment magic to sway mortals into joining her cult. She has convinced all her followers that she is in fact an avariel, and believes it herself even though she must cast seeming each day to \"reveal\" her wings.\n\nAerisi is prone to deluded flights of fancy and impulsive decadence. She sees herself as a beautiful, fierce, and just ruler who wields elemental power because she deserves it."

Driven out of one decent town after another, he finally sought refuge in an old outlaw's lair he discovered near Lance Rock. There he commenced his newest round of experiments, avoiding all other living souls.\n\nWhat few social graces Oreioth once possessed are fading rapidly. He has become a megalomaniac, styling himself the Lord of Lance Rock and surrounding himself with zombies and skeletons compelled to heed his every whim. Oreioth barely recognizes his own name anymore, and he harbors dreams of founding a kingdom of undead servitors with himself on the throne."

Now they follow the orders of the flamewraths and the cult leaders without question. Razerblasts fight confidently because they know that even if they lose, they go out in a blaze of glory."

For years, she was a dancer and concubine in a pasha's court in Calimshan. Later, she took up the mantle of prophet when she found Tinderstrike, and the same ruthless ambition and practiced manipulation that enabled her to escape a life of servitude serves her well as the head of a growing cult.\n\nFor Vanifer, battle is best observed at a distance. She prefers to hurl destructive magic from afar. Those who challenge Vanifer in melee learn a painful lesson, as she and Tinderstrike make a formidable pair.\n\nIn the Fire Node\n\nWhen enemies threaten the Temple of Eternal Flame, Vanifer withdraws to the Weeping Colossus, the fire node. Within this node, Vanifer gains one additional use of her Legendary Resistance trait."

When Aerisi was still with her family, Harald charmed and flattered his way into her favor. When Aerisi ran away from home to become the air prophet, she took Windharrow with her.\n\nAt Aerisi's insistence, Windharrow recruited a band of flutists from the ranks of new converts to the air cult, calling them the Windwyrds. Most have no musical talent whatsoever, and their music is often a shrill cacophony. Of all the air cultists, the Windwyrds are the least fanatical and the most fearful for their lives. Aerisi disposes of these minstrels on a whim, replacing them with other initiates. Those that master some skill with their instruments survive the longest, but the cost of failure creates a highly competitive environment among the minstrels.\n\nWindharrow is loyal to Aerisi Kalinoth as long as he fears her power. If his life is threatened or a richer offer presents itself, Windharrow betrays the air cult without a backward glance."

When he wishes to remain unseen, Yan-C-Bin manifests only as a gust of cold wind flowing silently past.\n\nFrom his floating palace in the endless, cloudy skies of the Plane of Air, Yan-C-Bin watches worlds as they change over millennia. Evil aerial creatures worship the elemental prince as a god, and claim to see Yan-C-Bin's eyes in swirling storms. Yan-C-Bin doesn't care for their offerings, their sacrifices, or their worship. His only concern is the annihilation of the material realms as they are ripped apart by the superior elemental might of air and wind."
