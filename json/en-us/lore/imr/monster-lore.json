Like an otyugh, a neo-otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion to ambush prey. Their improved intellect and innate spellcasting makes them especially effective against humanoid targets, as they use their powers of control to split off a straggler from a party, then attack."

His career began as a priest in the service of Moloch, where he rose through the ranks before eventually taking over the temple as a working laboratory. Most of his experiments have involved the pursuit of new forms of life, resulting in such creatures as the thessalhydra and the owlbear. In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of life—namely his own. Thessalar hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.\n\nOver time, Thessalar has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties. He regularly uses it as the basis for many of the reagents used throughout his labs."

Among the largest was the thessalkraken—a slightly smaller variant of the legendary kraken, resembling that great tentacled titan but with a jagged-toothed maw that drips constantly with acid.\n\nA thessalkraken lives in the dark depths, usually a sunken rift or a cavern filled with detritus, treasure, and the remains of sacrificial victims."
